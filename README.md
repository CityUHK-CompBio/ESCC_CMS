# ESCC_CMS
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) lacks a standardized classification.  This study presents a novel, robust four-subtype classification system, ECMS (ESCC Consensus Molecular Subtypes): ECMS1-MET (metabolic), ECMS2-CLS (classical), ECMS3-IM (immunomodulatory), and ECMS4-MES (mesenchymal).  Furthermore, we developed imECMS, an image-based classifier using deep learning to assign ESCC patients to these subtypes from H&E images.  ECMS/imECMS subtypes correlate with distinct molecular characteristics, prognoses, and treatment responses, providing a valuable tool for precision medicine in ESCC.

The repository contains the construction of ECMS and the implementation of a user-friendly image classifier(imECMS), including all the code required for generating figures for publication.
